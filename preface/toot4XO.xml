    Next we'll animate the basic sound by mixing it with two slightly de-tuned copies of itself. We'll employ Csound's <link linkend="cpspch"><citetitle>cpspch</citetitle></link> value converter which will allow us to specify the pitches by octave and pitch-class rather than by frequency, and we'll use the <link linkend="ampdb"><citetitle>ampdb</citetitle></link> converter to specify loudness in decibels rather than linearly.

    Since we are adding the outputs of three oscillators, each with the same amplitude envelope, we'll scale the amplitude before we mix them. Both <emphasis>iscale</emphasis> and <emphasis>inote</emphasis> are arbitrary names to make the design a bit easier to read. Each is an i-rate variable, evaluated when the instrument is initialized.
