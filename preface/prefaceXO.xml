    Csound is a programmable computer music system. It was originally written by Barry Vercoe at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984 in the C programming language, based on earlier systems like Music IV by Max Mathews. Since then, Csound has received numerous contributions from researchers, programmers, and musicians from around the world, and is still being actively developed by a group of passionate programmers.
