  <title>History of the Canonical Csound Reference Manual</title>
  <para>
    This initial version of this manual for early versions of Csound was started at MIT by &namebarry; and maintained there during the 1980's and start of the 1990's. Some of the manual comes from documents for programs like <emphasis>Music11</emphasis> from the 1970's. This original manual was improved and worked on by Richard Boulanger, &namejohn;, Jean Pich&eacute; and &namerasmus;.

    This manual led to the Official Csound Reference Manual, still located at: <ulink
    url="http://www.lakewoodsound.com/csound/hypertext/manual.htm">
    <citetitle>http://www.lakewoodsound.com/csound</citetitle></ulink>, 
    for Csound version 4.16, November, 1999, which was maintained by &namedavid;.

  <para>A parallel version of the manual called the Alternative Csound Reference Manual, was developed by
    &namekevin; using <ulink
    url="http://www.docbook.org/"><citetitle>DocBook/SGML</citetitle></ulink>. This version later became the Canonical version.
