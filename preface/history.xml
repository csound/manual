  <title>History of the Canonical Csound Reference Manual</title>
  <para>
    This initial version of this manual for early versions of Csound was started at MIT by Barry L. Vercoe and maintained there during the 1980's and start of the 1990's. Some of the manual comes from documents for programs like <emphasis>Music11</emphasis> from the 1970's. This original manual was improved and worked on by Richard Boulanger, John ffitch, Jean Piché and Rasmus Ekman.

    This manual led to the Official Csound Reference Manual, still located at: <ulink url="http://www.lakewoodsound.com/csound/hypertext/manual.htm">
    <citetitle>http://www.lakewoodsound.com/csound</citetitle></ulink>, 
    for Csound version 4.16, November, 1999, which was maintained by David M. Boothe.

  <para>A parallel version of the manual called the Alternative Csound Reference Manual, was developed by
    Kevin Conder using <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org/"><citetitle>DocBook/SGML</citetitle></ulink>. This version later became the Canonical version.
