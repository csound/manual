  <title>Realtime I/O with JACK Connection Kit</title>

  <para>
    Under a number of systems the JACK connection kit can be used for both
    audio and MIDI input/output. For more details on this, see

  <bridgehead>Using JACK</bridgehead>
        <para>The simplest way to use the JACK plugin enabling input and output is as follows:
        <screen>
          -+rtaudio=jack -i adc -o dac</screen>
        Additionally, there are some command line options specific to JACK:
        <variablelist>
          <title>JACK Command-line Flags</title>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>-+jack_client=[client_name]</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                The client name used by Csound, defaults to 'csound6'.
                If multiple instances of Csound connect to the JACK server,
                different client names need to be used to avoid name
                conflicts.
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>-+jack_inportname=[input port name prefix], -+jack_outportname=[output port name prefix]
            </term>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                Name prefix of Csound JACK input/output ports; the default is
                'input' and 'output'. The actual port name is the channel number
                appended to the name prefix.
                Example: with the above default settings, a stereo orchestra will
                create these ports in full duplex operation:
                <screen>
csound6:input1              (record left)
csound6:input2              (record right)
csound6:output1             (playback left)
csound6:output2             (playback right)</screen>
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
      </para>
      <bridgehead>Connecting Csound to other JACK clients</bridgehead>
      <para>
        By default, connections are made to the first ports on the jack port list
	(generally these default to system physical ports).The plugin can connect to
        ports specified as names or numbers.
      </para>

      <para>
	As names: the port name prefix is used, e.g. "system:playback_",
	"system:capture_",   "alsa_pcm:playback_"  or "alsa_pcm:capture_".
	For example: -odac:system:playback_ (for output), -iadc:system:capture_.
	The port name prefix excludes channel names. 
      </para>

      <para>
	As numbers: the base port number is given, where the connection
	is made to this and subsequent ports up to the number of channels.
	For a base port number N we will have the connections as N+0, N+1,
	..., N+nchnls-1. For instance -odac2 with nchnls=1 will connect
	outputs to ports 2 and 3. Ports are listed as in other input/output
	backends.
      </para>

      <para>
	Note that ports can be prevented from autoconnecting by passing
	-odac:null and -iadc:null, for output and input, respectively. Connections
	can also be made manually using jack connection tools.
      </para>
      
      <bridgehead>Notes on buffer sizes</bridgehead>
      <para>
        Audio data is received from and sent to the JACK server by Csound
        using a ring buffer that is controlled by the -b and -B flags.
        -B is the total size of the buffer, while -b is the size of a
        single period. These values are rounded so that the total size is
        an integer multiple of, and greater than the period size.
        The difference of the Csound buffer and period size must be greater
        than or equal to the JACK period size.
      </para>
      <para>
	If both -iadc and -odac are used at the same time, the -b option
	should be set to an integer multiple of ksmps.
      </para>
      <para>
	An example of buffer settings for low latency on a fast Linux system:
	<screen>
          jackd -d alsa -P -r 48000 -p 64 -n 4 -zt &amp;
          csound -+rtaudio=jack -b 64 -B 256 [...]</screen>
	with real time scheduling (as root):
	<screen>
          jackd -R -P 90 -d alsa -P -r 48000 -p 64 -n 2 -zt &amp;
          csound --sched=80,90,10 -d -+rtaudio=jack -b 64 -B 192 [...]</screen>
	To improve performance, use ksmps values like 32 and 64.
      </para>
      <para>
	The sample rate of the orchestra must be the same as that of the
	JACK server.
      </para>
            <para>
	Jack can also be used for MIDI IO. For this -+rtmidi=jack is
	needed. For input -M followed by the requested jack MIDI port name is
	used to connect directly to an input stream. For output -Q
	followed by the jack port name is used. The options
	-+jack_midi_inportname= and -+jack_midi_outportname= can be
	used to rename Csound's MIDI IO ports.
