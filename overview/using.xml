  <title>Using Csound</title>

  <para>Csound can be operated in a variety of modes and
    configurations. The original method for running Csound was as a console
    program (DOS prompt for Windows, Terminal for Mac OS X). This, of course,
    still works. Running
    <application>csound</application> without any arguments prints out a
    list of command-line options, which are more fully explained in the
    <link linkend="CommandFlagsCategory"><citetitle>Command Line Flags
    (by Category)</citetitle></link> section.
    Normally, the user executes something
    like:
    <programlisting>csound myfile.csd</programlisting>
    or separate orchestra (orc) and score (sco) files can be used:
    <programlisting>csound myorchestra.orc myscore.sco</programlisting>
    You can find many .csd files in the examples folder. Most opcode entries in this manual also include simple .csd files showing the usage of the opcode.
  </para>
  <para>
    There are also many <link linkend="OviewFrontEnds"><citetitle>Front-Ends</citetitle></link> 
    which can be used to run
    <application>csound</application>. A 
    <link linkend="OviewFrontEnds"><citetitle>Front-End</citetitle></link> is a graphical program
    that eases the process of running csound, and sometimes provides editing
    and composing functions.

    Csound also has several ways of producing output. It can:

      <note>This output is from csound5; later versions may differ a bit.</note>
      When Csound runs, it prints a text output to the console, which shows data about the Csound run. A Console output looks something like this:

      The console output of Csound is quite verbose, particularly before the actual performance (like version, plugins loaded, etc.). Performance actually started when the console printed:
      <programlisting>SECTION 1:</programlisting>
      In this particular run, the lines:
      <programlisting>new alloc for instr 1:
B  0.000 ..  2.000 T  2.000 TT  2.000 M:  10000.0  10000.0</programlisting>
      Show that a single note for instrument 1, that lasted 2 seconds starting at time 0.000, was produced with an amplitude of 10000 for both channel 1 and 2. An important section of the console output is:
      <programlisting>end of score.              overall amps:  10000.0  10000.0
           overall samples out of range:        0        0</programlisting>
      Which shows the overall amplitude and the number of samples which were clipped because they were out of range.
    </para>
<!--     The following paragraph adapted from an email by Victor Lazzarini in the Csound mailing list -->
    <para>
      The line:
      <programlisting>Elapsed time at end of performance: real: 2.341s, CPU: 0.050s</programlisting>
      Shows the clock time and the CPU time it takes for the processor to complete the task. If CPU time is lower than clock time it means the csd can run in realtime (unless it has some sections which are extremely CPU intensive). The "real time" figure is the total running time and it is larger because it acounts for disk access. module loading, etc. (CPU time is strictly number-crunching time). If you have a sound that lasts for 100s and it takes 5s to generate it offline, it means that you are taking around 5% of CPU, and that it runs on 0.05 of realtime.

  <section id="UsingRealTime">

    <title>Real-Time Audio</title>
    <para>
      The following information applies mostly to csound being run directly from the command line. Front-ends implement these features in different ways, but knowledge of them is necessary in some of them.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusLowerI"><citetitle>-i</citetitle></link> and <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusLowerO"><citetitle>-o</citetitle></link> flags can be used to specify realtime output instead of the ordinary non-realtime file output. You should use <literal>-o dac</literal> for realtime output and <literal>-i adc</literal> for realtime input. Naturally, you can use either one or both if your hardware supports it. You can also specify the hardware you want to use by appending a device number or name to the flag (See <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusLowerI"><citetitle>-i</citetitle></link> and <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusLowerO"><citetitle>-o</citetitle></link>).
    </para>
    <para>
      You might also need to use the <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusPlusRtaudio"><citetitle>-+rtaudio</citetitle></link> flag to specify the driver interface to be used. Csound defaults to using Portaudio, which is cross-plaform and reliable, but for better performance, you might need to use ALSA or JACK on linux, and CoreAudio on Mac. You can use ASIO on Windows if your version of Portaudio has been compiled with ASIO support.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can see a list of available devices by giving a device number which is out of range, for instance <literal>-o dac99</literal>. This will also reveal if you have ASIO available if you are using PortAudio.
    </para>
    <bridgehead>
      Period &amp; Buffer Sizes</bridgehead>
    <para>Period and buffer sizes will vary greatly from one machine to
      another. Lower buffer sizes will result in lower latency, but might 
      cause breakups or clicks in the audio. The Csound
      flags which control period and buffer sizes are <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusLowerB"><citetitle>-b</citetitle></link> and <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusUpperB"><citetitle>-B</citetitle></link>,
      respectively. Buffer size is hardware dependant, and some
      experimentation may be necessary to find the optimal balance between
      low latency performance and uninterrupted audio output. The values
      given to <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusLowerB"><citetitle>-b</citetitle></link> and <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusUpperB"><citetitle>-B</citetitle></link> should be powers of two, and the value of <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusUpperB"><citetitle>-B</citetitle></link>
      should be at least one power of two higher than that of <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusLowerB"><citetitle>-b</citetitle></link>.
    </para>
    <para>Currently, with <literal><link linkend="FlagsCatMinusUpperB"><citetitle>-B</citetitle></link></literal> set to 512, audio output latency
      is about 12 milliseconds, fast enough for reasonably responsive
      keyboad playing. Even shorter latencies, are feasible on some systems.</para>
    <bridgehead>Control Rate</bridgehead>
    <para>
      Low values for ksmps will in general give a higher quality of
      synthesis, but will consume more system resources. There is no hard
      and fast rule for setting ksmps - different orchestras will require
      different control rates. A waveguide instrument will need a ksmps of
      1 (and may not be suitable for realtime use), whereas a simple FM
      synth may be run with a higher ksmps without noticeable degradation of
      sound. If the FM synth were to be used to play a monophonic bassline,
      a very low ksmps may be used, however more complex note clusters will
      require a higher ksmps. A well-tuned Linux system should be capable of
      running even complex polyphonic synths with ksmps values as low as 4
      or 8. If full duplex audio is required, <link linkend="FlagsCatMinusLowerB"><citetitle>-b</citetitle></link> must be an integer
      multiple of ksmps. Bearing this in mind, a rule of thumb might be to
      only use powers of two for ksmps.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some settings differ according to platform. See further below for information for each platform.
