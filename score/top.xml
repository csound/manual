  <title>The Standard Numeric Score</title>
  <para>
    The score section contains events that instatiate instruments from the orchestra. There are various score statements that enable complex score building within the csound language.
  </para>
  <para>
    Currently, the maximum length of the score depends on the
    platform's architecture; on a 32bit system tis is
    2<superscript>31</superscript>-1 control periods; so for example,
    with kr=1500, you can run a score for a maximum of about 16.5 days
    before problems occur due to overflowing signed 32-bit integer
    variables.  On a 64bit machine the same condition would be
    just about 9 billion years. The input token 'z' is read as a
    number with the value of approximately 25367 years.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note also that when using single precision floats (i.e. the 'f'
    installers rather than the 'd' ones), the accuracy of timing
    becomes worse after performing for a long time.
