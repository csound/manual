    <title>Initialization</title>
    <para>
      <emphasis>iscl</emphasis> -- coded scaling factor, similar to
      that in <link linkend="reson"><citetitle>reson</citetitle></link>. A non-zero
      value signifies a peak response factor of 1, i.e. all
      frequencies other than <emphasis>kcf</emphasis> are attenuated
      in accordance with the (normalized) response curve. A zero value
      signifies no scaling of the signal, leaving that to some later
      adjustment (see <link linkend="balance"><citetitle>balance</citetitle></link>). The
      default value is 0.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>iskip</emphasis> (optional, default=0) -- initial
      disposition of internal data space. Since filtering incorporates
      a feedback loop of previous output, the initial status of the
      storage space used is significant. A zero value will clear the
      space; a non-zero value will allow previous information to
      remain. The default value is 0.

    <title>Performance</title>
    <para>
      <emphasis>svfilter</emphasis> is a second order state-variable filter, with k-rate controls for cutoff frequency and Q.  As Q is increased, a resonant peak forms around the cutoff frequency. <emphasis>svfilter</emphasis> has simultaneous lowpass, highpass, and bandpass filter outputs; by mixing the outputs together, a variety of frequency responses can be generated. The state-variable filter, or "multimode" filter was a common feature in early analog synthesizers, due to the wide variety of sounds available from the interaction between cutoff, resonance, and output mix ratios. <emphasis>svfilter</emphasis> is well suited to the emulation of "analog" sounds, as well as other applications where resonant filters are called for.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>kcf</emphasis> -- Cutoff or resonant frequency of the filter, measured in Hz.
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>kq</emphasis> -- Q of the filter, which is defined (for bandpass filters) as bandwidth/cutoff. <emphasis>kq</emphasis> should be in a range between 1 and 500. As <emphasis>kq</emphasis> is increased, the resonance of the filter increases, which corresponds to an increase in the magnitude and "sharpness" of the resonant peak. When using <emphasis>svfilter</emphasis> without any scaling of the signal (where <emphasis>iscl</emphasis> is either absent or 0), the volume of the resonant peak increases as Q increases. For high values of Q, it is recommended that <emphasis>iscl</emphasis> be set to a non-zero value, or that an external scaling function such as <link linkend="balance"><citetitle>balance</citetitle></link> is used.
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>svfilter</emphasis> is based upon an algorithm in Hal Chamberlin's <emphasis>Musical Applications of Microprocessor</emphasis>s (Hayden Books, 1985).
