    <title>Description</title>
    <para>
      Macros are textual replacements which are made in the orchestra as it is being read.  The <link linkend="OrchMacros"><citetitle>orchestra macro system</citetitle></link> in Csound is a very simple one, and uses the characters &num; and &dollar; to define and call macros. This can save typing, and can lead to a coherent structure and consistent style.  This is similar to, but independent of, the <link linkend="ScoreMacros"><citetitle>macro system in the score language</citetitle></link>.

    <para>&num;includestr is similar to &num;include except that the file
    name must be delimited by a double quote character and the file
    name is subjected to macro expansion.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is sometimes convenient to have the orchestra arranged in a
      number of files, for example with each instrument in a separate
      file.  This style is supported by the
      <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> facility which is part of the
      macro system.  A line containing the text 

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<emphasis role="omacro">#include</emphasis> "filename"</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      where the character &quot; can be replaced by any suitable
      character in &num;include (but not in &num;includestr).  For
      most uses the double quote symbol will probably be the most
      convenient. The file name can include a full path.
    </para>

    <para>
      This takes input from the named file until it ends, when input
      reverts to the previous input. 
      <emphasis>Note: </emphasis>Csound versions prior to 4.19 had a limit of 20 on the depth of included files and macros.
    </para>

    <para>
      Another suggested use of <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> would be to define a set of macros which are part of the composer's style.
    </para>

    <para>
      An extreme form would be to have each instrument defines as a macro, with the instrument number as a parameter.  Then an entire orchestra could be constructed from a number of <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> statements followed by macro calls.

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<emphasis role="omacro">#include</emphasis> "clarinet"
<emphasis role="omacro">#include</emphasis> "flute"
<emphasis role="omacro">#include</emphasis> "bassoon"
$CLARINET(1)
$FLUTE(2)
$BASSOON(3)</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      It must be stressed that these changes are at the textual level and so take no cognizance of any meaning.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the version of Csound is built with the CURL library the
      filename in an <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> statement can
      be an URL, recognised by including the substring "://" in the
      name.  This will include text via protocols such as http, https,
      and ftp.
