    <para>
      It is sometimes convenient to have the orchestra arranged in a number of files, for example with each instrument in a separate file.  This style is supported by the <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> facility which is part of the macro system.  A line containing the text

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<emphasis role="omacro">#include</emphasis> "filename"</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      where the character &quot; can be replaced by any suitable character.  For most uses the double quote symbol will probably be the most convenient. The file name can include a full path.
    </para>

    <para>
      This takes input from the named file until it ends, when input reverts to the previous input.
      <emphasis>Note: </emphasis>Csound versions prior to 4.19 had a limit of 20 on the depth of included files and macros.
    </para>

    <para>
      Another suggested use of <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> would be to define a set of macros which are part of the composer's style.
    </para>

    <para>
      An extreme form would be to have each instrument defines as a macro, with the instrument number as a parameter.  Then an entire orchestra could be constructed from a number of <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> statements followed by macro calls.

      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
<emphasis role="omacro">#include</emphasis> "clarinet"
<emphasis role="omacro">#include</emphasis> "flute"
<emphasis role="omacro">#include</emphasis> "bassoon"
$CLARINET(1)
$FLUTE(2)
$BASSOON(3)</programlisting>
      </informalexample>

      It must be stressed that these changes are at the textual level and so take no cognizance of any meaning.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the version of Csound is built with the CURL library the
      filename in an <emphasis>&num;include</emphasis> statement can
      be an URL, recognised by including the substring "://" in the
      name.  This will include text via protocols such as http, https,
      and ftp.
