  <title>Directories and Files</title>

  <para>
    Many generators and the Csound command itself specify filenames to be read from or written to. These are optionally full pathnames, whose target directory is fully specified. When not a full path, filenames are sought in several directories in order, depending on their type and on the setting of certain environment variables. The latter are optional, but they can serve to partition and organize the directories so that source files can be shared rather than duplicated in several user directories. The environment variables can define directories for soundfiles <link linkend="CommandEnvironment"><citetitle>SFDIR</citetitle></link>, sound samples <link linkend="CommandEnvironment"><citetitle>SSDIR</citetitle></link>, sound analysis SADIR, and include files for orchestra and score files INCDIR.

  <para>
    In Csound version 5.00 and later, these environment variables can specify
    multiple directories as a ; separated list. If a file is found in more than
    one location, the first one has the highest precedence.

  <para>
    The search order is:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Soundfiles being written are placed in <link linkend="CommandEnvironment"><citetitle>SFDIR</citetitle></link> (if it exists), else the current directory.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Soundfiles for reading are sought in the current directory. If default
          paths are not disabled, files will next be sought for relative to the
          CSD/ORC/SCO file. Finally they will be sought in <link linkend="CommandEnvironment"><citetitle>SSDIR</citetitle></link> and then SFDIR.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Analysis control files for reading are sought in the current
          directory. If default paths are not disabled, files will next be
          sought for relative to the CSD/ORC/SCO file. Finally they will be
          sought in SADIR.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          MIDI files for reading are sought in the current directory. If default
          paths are not disabled, files will next be sought for relative to the
          CSD/ORC/SCO file. Finally they will be sought in MFDIR, <link linkend="CommandEnvironment"><citetitle>SSDIR</citetitle></link> and
          <link linkend="CommandEnvironment"><citetitle>SFDIR</citetitle></link>.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Files of code to be included in orchestra and score files (with
          <link linkend="include"><citetitle>#include</citetitle></link>) are
          sought first in the current directory, then in the same directory as
          the orchestra or score file (as appropriate), then finally INCDIR.

  <para>
    Beginning with Csound version 3.54, the file <quote>csound.txt</quote> contains the messages (in binary format) that Csound uses to provide information to the user during performance. This allows for the messages to be in any language, although the default is English. This file must be placed in the same directory as the Csound executable. Alternatively, this file may be stored in SFDIR, SSDIR, or SADIR. Unix users may also keep this file in <quote>/usr/local/lib/</quote>. The environment variable CSSTRNGS may be used to define the directory in which the database resides. This can be overridden with the <emphasis>-j</emphasis> command line option. (New in  version 3.55)
