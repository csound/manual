  <title>K-Rate Vectors</title>
  <para>
    Csound allows the declaration and deployment of one-dimensional
    vectors or tables.  They are local to an instrument, and need to
    be declared for size (with the <link linkend="init"><citetitle>init</citetitle></link> opcode.
    Individual elements are read as part of any expression with square
    brackets to give an index at k-rate.  Individual elements can be
    assigned, and there are a number of opcodes to query and modify tables.
