  <title>Ordinary Statements</title>
  <para>
    An <emphasis>ordinary statement</emphasis> runs at either init time or performance time or both. Operations which produce a result formally run at the rate of that result (that is, at init time for i-rate results; at performance time for k- and a-rate results), with the sole exception of the <emphasis>init</emphasis> opcode. Most generators and modifiers, however, produce signals that depend not only on the instantaneous value of their arguments but also on some preserved internal state. These performance-time units therefore have an implicit init-time component to set up that state. The run time of an operation which produces no result is apparent in the opcode.

  <para>
    Arguments are values that are sent to an operation. Most arguments will accept arithmetic expressions composed of constants, variables, reserved symbols, value converters, arithmetic operations, and conditional values.
