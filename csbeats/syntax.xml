    The <emphasis>csbeats</emphasis> language is very simple, having
    only 5  kinds of statement, and only one of them has any
    complexity.  In general the introductory word for each statement
    type is case insensitive, so "QUIT", "quit", "QuIt"... are all
    the same.  Comments can be introduced in either ANSI C89 format
    or C++ (that is either /* ... */ or // to the end of line) or
      Csound's semicolon.
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><emphasis>QUIT</emphasis>
    <para>
      Causes csbeats to exit.  For
      flexibility the command <emphasis>END</emphasis> is also
      accepted for the identical action.
    </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><emphasis>BEATS</emphasis>=integer
    <para>
      Sets the number of beats
      per minute for the following score until the end or until it is
      reset.  The default value is 60bpm.  The token
      <emphasis>BPS</emphasis> is also acceptable instead of BEATS.  
    </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><emphasis>PERMEASURE</emphasis>=integer
    <para>
      Sets the number of
        beats in a bar.  The default value is 4.
    </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><emphasis>BAR</emphasis>
    <para>
      Start a new bar.
    </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem><emphasis>BAR</emphasis> integer
    <para>
      Start the bar whose number is
      given.
    </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <emphasis>i</emphasis> integer attributes
      <para>
        Specified a note event for the numbered instrument.  The
        attributes may be any of a pitch, duration or dynamic, or a
        positioning of the note to a beat or measure, and can be in
        any order.
      </para>
      <para>
        Pitches are specified with a conventional note name (English
        form) in upper case optionally followed by a #, x (for
        double sharp), b (for flat) or bb (for double flat). 
        A note of Z is a rest (think zzzz).  All notes except rests
        must be followed by an octave number, with A4 being
        international A (440Hz).  Pitches are passed to Csound in
        Hertz in the parameter p4, and are twelve tone equal temprament.
      </para>
      <para>
        Durations are coded in lower case with the initial letter of
        the name for <emphasis>w</emphasis>hole,
        <emphasis>h</emphasis>alf, <emphasis>q</emphasis>uarter,
        <emphasis>e</emphasis>igth and <emphasis>s</emphasis>ixteeth
        notes, or <emphasis>th</emphasis> for thirtysecondth notes.
        Except for <emphasis>w</emphasis> these can be moderated by
        appending as suffix:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <emphasis>d</emphasis> or <emphasis>.</emphasis> Dotted
            note (half as long again) 
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <emphasis>dd</emphasis> or <emphasis>..</emphasis> Dotted
            note (three quarters as long again) 
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <emphasis>t</emphasis> Triplet note (third notes in
            two)
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <emphasis>t.</emphasis> Dotted triplet note
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <emphasis>q</emphasis> Quintuplet (Five notes in four)
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <emphasis>s</emphasis> Septuplet (Seven notes in eight)
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        Durations can be added together by giving more that one
        duration.  To make this more intuitive a + sign can be used
        instead of white space.
      </para>
      <para>
        The dynamics are written in conventional notation, that is fff,
        ff, f, mf, mp, p, pp, ppp, pppp.  These are passed to the instrument
        as p5 as 0 for fff, and one less dB for each step below.  The
        default dynamic is fortissimo.
      </para>
      <para>
        Additional parameters (p-fields) can be specified in an
        instrument statement by giving statements like
        <emphasis>p6=42</emphasis> which would set the p6 field to 42
        until it is changed.  The number must be 6 or greater as the
        first 5 fields are taken with fixed information.  Each
        instrument number has its own additional parameters.
      </para>
      <para>
        If any of these attributes is missing it carried forward from the
        previous note, with beat position being incremented to the end
        of the previous note.
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition an event can be directed to a particular measure with
        an m attribute or a particular beat with a b.
